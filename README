# Bomberman Game (Game Boy Inspired)

This project recreates the classic Game Boy Bomberman experience with a tile-based arena, 1v1 multiplayer, and a lightweight Python code base. The code is organised into a `src/` directory for runtime modules, `assets/` for sprite data, and `tests/` for simulation-driven validation of the main mechanics.

## Features

- Authentic 13x11 Bomberman arena layout with indestructible pillars and destructible crates.
- Basic sprite set stored in the `assets/` folder and scaled to match the Game Boy aesthetic.
- Player movement, bomb placement, explosion propagation, and simple power-up upgrades (extra bomb and flame length).
- Local 1v1 support using keyboard input (WASD/Space for Player 1 and arrow keys/Enter for Player 2).
- Round management with score keeping and quick reset functionality.
- Headless game-state tests covering tile destruction, collision handling, power-up collection, and win detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

```bash
python -m src.main
```

The window opens at the scaled Game Boy resolution. Player 1 uses `WASD` to move and `Space` to drop bombs. Player 2 uses the arrow keys and `Enter`. Press `Esc` to quit or `R` to reset after a round ends.

> **Note:** pygame requires an available display environment. When running on a headless machine, configure SDL with a virtual display (e.g., `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`) before starting the game.

## Running Tests

Execute the automated tests headlessly with:

```bash
pytest
```

These tests interact directly with the simulation logic, so they do not require a graphical environment.

```

- `src/bomberman/` holds the arena, entity, state management, and asset loader modules.
- `src/main.py` is the executable entry point that wires pygame rendering to the simulation.
- `assets/` contains simple PPM sprites that are scaled at runtime.
- `tests/` contains pytest cases that validate movement, bombing, power-ups, and win conditions.

## Packaging Notes

The project relies only on pygame and pytest, both defined in `requirements.txt`. Create a distributable archive with:

```bash
python -m build
```

(Install `build` if needed: `pip install build`). The resulting wheel includes the source modules; ensure the `assets/` directory is bundled when distributing the game.
